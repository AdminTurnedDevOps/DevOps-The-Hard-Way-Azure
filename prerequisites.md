# Prerequisites

## Prior Knowledge In Tech

DevOps isn't an entry level role by any means if it's being done correctly. There's a lot of knowledge you need prior, including:
- Some sort of cloud engineering/cloud knowledge experience. Although not all environments are running in the cloud, most of these roles will want it.
- Scripting/automation/programming experience. You don't have to go out and build the next Instagram, but you should understand the basics of programming.
- Network, storage, and compute knowledge.
- Held a prior systems administration, infrastructure engineer, or cloud engineer role.

## Azure

### Use the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is a way for you to interact with all Azure services at a programmatic level using the terminal.

To set this up, follow the directions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Installations
You will need to download some software and services for this tutorial.

### Code Editor

Because code will be written for *DevOps The Hard Way*, you will need a code editor. For the purposes of this tutorial, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), which is a free code editor.

### Terraform

[Terraform Download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Docker
To build the Docker image, you can use Docker Desktop for Windows or MacOS.

### Source Control
To store the code that you'll be writing, you can create your very own GitHub account to showcase your project.
